        <h2>Proplem:</h2>
         <p>For many, especially working women and mothers, juggling responsibilities often leaves little time for 
             shopping or relaxation. Women often need quick solutions to shop for their favorite makeup products or book a spa appointment.</p>

              <h2>Solution </h2>
              <p>Perfect Woman offers a website that empowers women to shop for beauty products or book a spa appointment during a break at

                </h2>
                <h2>Research and persona:
                </h2>
                <p>During the research phase, I conducted a competitor analysis, a business analysis, and a sitemap. I was able to gain a thorough understanding
                   of the market, potential customers, and key product requirements. I created a persona to collect data and conduct research based on it.
                    The story of the persona She‚Äôs a working mother with three children. She struggles to find time for herself, let alone shop or relax.
                    Despite her busy schedule, she cherishes her self-care routines and seeks quick, accessible solutions.</p>

                <section class="ideation"><h1>IDEATION</h1>
                <p>For a user research, I conducted a study and created the personas to analyze pain points and determine priorities. Then I generated Sitemap to understand where in the process users were having troubles, created sketches, Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes.

                  The project timeline is two weeks. Let‚Äôs dive into the process of creating a responsive website.</p>

                <h2>Sketch (Paper Wireframe)
                </h2>
                <p>I started to draw my paper sketches. I choose between two of what I would combine on my low-fi wireframe. My draw was bad, but as a designer, I have to make sketches with design ideas ‚Äúquantity, not quality.‚Äù üôÇ</p>

                <h2>Wireframe:
                </h2>
                <p>I fleshed out the UI sketches, created mid-fi wireframes, and got down the clickable prototype for validation testing. I conducted validation testing, and found out a couple of issues need to be
                   adjusted. For example, to make filters more prominent on the landing page so it can give user a clear signal that it is the primary call to action.</p>

                <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype:</h2>
                <p>After validating my mid-Fi prototype, i made iterations to my design, and moved into Hi-Fi phase. I created Hi-Fi prototype for the buyer‚Äôs flow including home page, Book at spa and add to cart</p>

                <p>To illustrate the user journey, I created an animated prototype demonstrating the flow from landing on the homepage to adding an item to the cart, navigating the site, and booking a spa service.</p>
