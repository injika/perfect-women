  A Perfect Woman is a responsive Web that helps users find their favorite
   beauty products and find time to relax by booking in a spa.</p>

     <h2>Challenges
    </h2>
     <p>Creating a responsive web allows users to easily navigate between pages 
      while shopping and adding their favorite products. Also for reservations for an appointment.</p>

         <br>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design the web app to create a professional, trustworthy, and friendly user experience.</li>
        <li>Optimize the web experience on mobile devices;
        </li>
        <li>Create an easy and flowy web navigation between pages;</li>
        <li>Add and remove items easily to the cart while shopping.</li>
      </ul>

         <h2>Define:
        </h2>
        <h2>Proplem:</h2>
         <p>Many people, especially working women, are so busy to go shopping and to get time for themselves.
           As is well known, women adore makeup and won‚Äôt dispense with it. Also, as a woman, I need time to get 
           out of working stress and have time to relax and relax after a long week of work.</p>

              <br>
              <h2>Solution </h2>
              <p>
                I created a responsive web app to let women on their desks, at work between breaks, order their favorite
                 makeup with one simple click without going shopping. Also, book in a spa at any time to relax and get away from stress and hard work.
             </p>

                <h2>Empathise:
                </h2>
                <h2>Research and persona:
                </h2>
                <p>During the research phase, I conducted a competitor analysis, a business analysis, and a sitemap. I was able to gain a thorough understanding
                   of the market, potential customers, and key product requirements. I created a persona to collect data and conduct research based on it.
                    The story of the persona She‚Äôs a working mother, has three children, and is struggling to have time for shopping and for herself to relax. 
                    She never takes a break and she wants a time for herself.</p>

                <section class="ideation"><h1>IDEATION</h1>
                <p>For a user research, I conducted a study and created the personas to analyze pain points and determine priorities. Then I generated Sitemap to understand where in the process users were having troubles, created sketches, Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes.

                  The project timeline is two weeks. Let‚Äôs dive into the process of creating a responsive website.</p>

                <h2>Sketch (Paper Wireframe)
                </h2>
                <p>I started to draw my paper sketches. I choose between two of what I would combine on my low-fi wireframe. My draw was bad, but as a designer, I have to make sketches with design ideas ‚Äúquantity, not quality.‚Äù üôÇ</p>

                <h2>Sitemap (Information Architecture)
                </h2>
                <p>In the site map, i‚Äôll make sure to uncover a seamless user experience with a sitemap designed for flow. From spa treatments to beauty products, you can easily navigate through our intuitive interface. 
                  Explore our selected departments, including spa services, beauty products and skincare tips.

                <h2>Wireframe:
                </h2>
                <p>I fleshed out the UI sketches, created low-fi wireframes, and got down the clickable prototype for validation testing. I conducted validation testing, and found out a couple of issues need to be
                   adjusted. For example, to make filters more prominent on the landing page so it can give user a clear signal that it is the primary call to action.</p>

                <h2>Hi-Fi Prototype:</h2>
                <p>After validating my Lo-Fi prototype, i made iterations to my design, and moved into Hi-Fi phase. I created Hi-Fi prototype for the buyer‚Äôs flow including home page, Book at spa and add to cart</p>

                </h2>
                <p>To demonstrate the proposed flow when a user looking to add item to cart, I generated animated prototype with activities from landing on the homepage, selecting item, brows the cart and navigate the site.</p>
